- **Playing sports can teach people lessons about life.**
  - Playing sports will teach you success and defeats are two sides of the same coin—twins, but not enemies. It teaches that failure can be turned into success if you bounce back higher than you fall. Failures happen &quot;for&quot; you, not &quot;to&quot; you, and nothing more than losing hope can sabotage your success. For example, it has been seen many times that in a football match, the losing team was able to score in the second half and snatch victory from jaws of defeat.
  - Playing sports will inculcate/instill an attitude of teamwork spirit into individuals.-\&gt;
 When engaging in sports activities, one learns how to cooperate with others in order to achieve the common objective of the group -\&gt;
 this quality is a must-have and sought-after skill in the workplace -\&gt;
 lead to better productivity, more efficacy, reduced costs, greater profitability, and many other benefits.
  - The ability to take failure and success alike is a valuable life experience that sports can teach us. When asked to what they attribute their outstanding achievements, successful individuals mention their mental outlook to embrace both triumph and defeat. This quality can be achieved by playing sports as it makes us understand that mistakes and failures can teach us valuable things.
- **Which kind of professors will you choose when selecting the courses?
 1. Some professors who are voted to be the most popular one
 2. Some professors who are rewarded of outstanding research**
  - Universities offer diversity of teachers and profs.
  - Research; the more research the more knowledge; you will palpably learn more; Experienced teachers are capable of demystifying the matters in a more excellent way, The professor shares his research experiences with the students. Ex: I was enrolled in a class whose instructor had a wealth of experience in conducting industrial projects and explained minute details about his projects. That course was, without exaggeration, the best course in my undergraduate years, and I learned a lot in that lesson.
  - More institutions will commission him to do other researches; know you -\&gt; opportunity to work for him; you will stand a better chance of getting a job. My roommate. A prof who published a paper in Nature; he was working on different projects simultaneously. He got a rewarding job in petroleum ministry with high salary.
- **It is important to have rules about the types of clothes that people wear in their
 workplace and at school.**
  - No; improper to force people what to wear; wear whatever they want to feel comfortable; from pedagogically standpoint increase productivity; school uniform; inconvenient I couldn&#39;t understand well in class
  - Feel free; different tastes; based on their temperament; I wear fashion but casual ; look approachable; don&#39;t spent a lot of time in front of the mirror
- **Some people think it is the best approach for students to learn if school start the day
 at an early time in the morning. But someone think the school should start the day at
 late time.
 Which one do you prefer?**

One of the most talked about things[** related to studying**](http://www.bellakulture.com/2015/04/the-best-study-tips-for-finals.html) is when exactly is the best time to hit the books? While this is most certainly affected by lifestyle and preferences, they are some pretty good reasons why as a college student you should study in the mornings.

  - Morning; after a tiring day it is hard to retain what you studied; eventful day, read the matters more than one; the later you study, the more tired your brain is; the less you understand; in morning you had the chance to clear your mind and is easy to maintain focus; Ex: I am a morning person,
  - As imp as brain condition is you physical condition, Mornings are great because you are at the most energetic level you&#39;ll be for the rest of the day. The more energetic you are, the more you are able to concentrate. One night I was studying I was sleepy next day I start reading the rest of the book I read about 10 pages and sud
- **Which one of the following is the best approach to reduce living expense?
 A. share the rent with roommate
 B. do not buy the latest technology products like cellphone frequently
 C. cook food at home.**
  - House costs are exceedingly high. Difficult for people to afford rentals. Share house with others is a cost-effective decision
  - It is not impossible to live w/o having latest tech products, so we do not usually spend a stupefying amount of money on them. There are local restaurants that sell economical food or you can use TV-dinner. I lived in dorm and I ate out most of the time, whereas I was student and did not have much money.
- Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
 Students do reading by their own personality is as important as, or more important

  - People can create many jobs by buying products in their own country. Unemployment rate is high. Young people need job.
- **When working on a project, it&#39;s better for classmates or colleagues to communicate
 face to face than sending emails**
  - Convey better -\&gt; obviates the risk of misunderstanding, assemble together, deliberation make collective decisions -\&gt; Ex: work on the same tasks
  - If only one member does not have access to net -\&gt; project will be stopped, lead to project postponement -\&gt; meet the deadlines -\&gt; fall behind on their works and lose the market.
  - Email/video conference obviates the need to collocate members and reduces ambiguity in commander&#39;s intention.
- **It&#39;s better to complete a project and then start another one than to do several things at
 the same time.**
  - Focus better

  - Advancement in tech
  - Hustle and bustle of modern life
- **The more money a person has, the more he or she should give away to the charities**
  - It is the duty of every member of society to think of one another. Make the society a better more humane place.
  - &quot;Human beings are all members of one frame,
 since all from the same essence came,
 when time afflicts a limb with pain,
 other limbs at rest cannot remain,&quot; or so Sa&#39;adi is quoted as saying.
 Ex: people are deprived from education, food, etc.

1. watch the recording by yourself
 2. invite other attenders to discuss and give opinions

  - ---
- **Which one do you think is important to long-lasting friendship?
 A. help you when you need
 B. share same interest and hobby
 C. mutual trust**

Human beings have perpetually been seeking a way to communicate with others. Friendship actually doesn&#39;t fit into any definition. It&#39;s a relationship that cannot be described with words. [friendship](https://www.mydomaine.com/what-is-friendship-1385639) is as important to our wellbeing as eating right and exercising. A vexed question that arises here is whether having common interests and hobbies plays a more significant role in friendship or friends solicitousness when they need one another. My impression is that mutual confidence of utmost importance.

- Honest friends would never talk behind your back – let you diagnose your weaknesses – you will work on them and be a better prsn which is invaluable. Ex: I had this roommate who always tried to criticize me in a friendly way. I learned a lot from eating habits to how manage work-life conflict.
- Honest friends will never lead you astray – they will never lie to you and will never give you wrong info – you can count on them whenever you run into difficulties- Ex: I was studying for exam, one my classmates who was terribly jealous, came up to me and said, &quot;have you studied these chapters? The teacher told me that there will be some questions from these chapters.&quot; I spend the rest of the time studying those trivial matters which I later discovered were

- **Are government doing good in educating people to pay attention to the importance
 of the food nutrition and healthy eating?**
  - Eating impotance ----
  - No; government should pay painstaking attention in young people eating habits, the prevalence of obesity is exceedingly high among teenagers, TV advertisements are the main culprit. Kids today badger their parents to buy them junk foods. Ex: my cousin in only 13 years old and his weight is 130 pounds which is excruciatingly bad for a boy at that age.
  - Another culprit of obesity among people is social medium. you can hardly scroll through Instagram without passing by a must-try fat-laden and sugar-rich meals. Governments should try to dissuade people from eating unhealthy food. Ex: You might have seen such video clips of Big burgers, French fries, choice succulent steaks, pizzas and so forth.
- **Speaking courses should be mandatory for students**
  - Incongruous courses may waste Ss time. My friend speech was barely comprehensible
  - Speaking is hard. While speaking you should tread lightly. Helps ss to conquer their stage fright and get the better of their fear.
- 190112WR) **One can learn about another person from the books and movies that the person likes.**
  - ---find a suitable sentence for the time you cannot decide
  - The books and movies one like shows their taste. Your taste in choosing books and movies depends on your temperament. Knowing one&#39;s temperament, you can learn about them in an excellent way and find out their idiosyncrasy. Ex: I do not usually read a lot of books but the ones I like tend to be like serious, scientific books, concerning real issues and describing ppl in a realistic way. I am an engineer, I cannot find any point in those fiction books.
  - Personality and predisposition of a person is inextricably linked to the books and movies they like. Movies and books at times are for recreation and people may try different types of them. But they would not like all of them. If they like a specific genera, it means that it was in their line of thought or character. Ex: An extensive body of research that examine the link between human characteristics and region they live showed that people of different countries have different tastes in movies. Therefore can say one can learn about a person by watching movies.
- 190126WR ) **In order to succeed in study or job, the ability to adjust or adapt to changing conduction or circumstance is more important than having knowledge.**
  - Merits and demerits to each one
  - On the one hand, having relevant knowledge, one have the ability to know the tasks the job may entail and how to tackle them. They would be able to make timely decisions. Increase efficacy Ex: I worked at a company as a content provider as a sideline while finishing for my masters. My responsibilities were not in the line of my education, but I saw my colleagues who had studied in pertinent areas worked much better than me.
  - On the other hand, life is chaotic and it is impossible to predict all the circumstances. There might be abrupt changes in the life which one has to be able to adapt to them or devise a new way to surmount the obstacles; otherwise, they might wreak havoc on their lives. Ex: During the COVID-19 outbreak, a lot of people have been laid off, many other employees have been forced to work outsource. The people who were not familiar with internet, computer and stuff couldn&#39;t survive.
- **Leadership abilities**
  - Leader must be able to resolve/settle the sporadic conflicts/arguments among the members of the group.
  - Leader has to bear in mind that members of the group -------------------. Leader has to bear the responsibility for …-

- **Teamwork**
  - The importance of teamwork is essential in today&#39;s multidisciplinary world. In this day and age, most of the projects/jobs involve interacting with others that are not even in the same line of profession. The need for effective teamwork is critical for any business.

  - Teamwork enables the members to split an enormously mammoth task into simpler ones -\&gt;
 every person develops specialized skills and avoids multitasking, therefore there would be the best person for each task that can accomplish it in a more excellent way, and the work will not be daunting and wearing anymore. -\&gt;
 lead to better productivity, more efficacy, reduced costs, greater profitability, and many other benefits.
  - Teammates observe and depend on the quality of each other&#39;s work. When one team member&#39;s performance declines, others have the knowledge and motivation to help them improve. -\&gt; smoother and looser structure, convivial and cordial atmosphere -\&gt;

**Example for environmental problems and government duties**

For example, a steel plant was built near my town. Due to the incorrect location, this factory is located in the direction of the winds toward the city, and all of its pollutions enter the city, which has caused dissatisfaction among residents. People even assembled in front of the municipality building and protested, but because of the large number of unemployed workers, the government failed to tackle the problem and the factory resumed operation.

I remember once working for a content providing company. My job was to produce technical content about new cars.

## Teamwork

The importance of teamwork is essential in today&#39;s multidisciplinary world.

In this day and age, most of the projects/jobs involve interacting with others that are not even in the same line of profession. The need for effective teamwork is critical for any business.

**Teamwork enables the members to split an enormously mammoth task into simpler ones -\&gt;
 every person develops specialized skills, therefore there would be the best person for each task that can accomplish it in a more excellent way. -\&gt;
 lead to better productivity, more efficacy, reduced costs, greater profitability, and many other benefits.**

Teammates observe and depend on the quality of each other&#39;s work. When one team member&#39;s performance declines, others have the knowledge and motivation to help them improve. -\&gt; smoother and looser structure, convivial and cordial atmosphere -\&gt;

Approach your colleague with friendly questions, rather than accusations.

In a team, all members must work towards the main goals of the team

If a member of the group moves in the opposite direction, it slows down the process.

They might be **ostracized**.

Take my personal experience as an example, I was in a robotics group preparing for an international competition. Our group consisted of 6 people, each with his own task. The rivalry between teams was extraordinarily fierce and we had to work diligently to meet the deadline. One of the members of the group, who was in charge of documenting the group&#39;s activities, always objected, and this affects the whole group adversely. Such terrible was the situation that despite winning that year&#39;s tournament, the members refused to cooperate again for next years.

I remember once working for a content-providing company in which my responsibilities included producing technical content about new cars. One of my co-workers always objected, and we were changing schedules constantly, which slowed things down to a great extent, and we fell behind the market.
