o	Although some may disagree, I believe …


	Family 
o	Family is the sole group who truly cares for us and, we can count on them whenever we run into difficulties. They give us their unqualified support and subordinate their personal interests to those of us. For example, on a rainy day, you can cadge money from your family and they might help you without reservation.
o	Our family members are the ones who know us the best and advise us better than any other people. For example, when you wanna choose a major to study, it seems more rational to consult your family because they know your interests in a superior way. 

	Children 
o	Parents should not constrain their children from doing what they want. They should incent them without incensing them.
o	Were I a father, I would never interfere in my children’s lives and would let them do whatever they want at their own free will. Some parents want to project their unfulfilled dreams onto their children. My parents used to force me to be a doctor, which was utterly preposterous.

	Parents should not be allowed to watch children’s grades without their permissions

Parents may blame them for their failure in a course without deep knowledge for reasons. They intensify the tension on students. Which aggravate the student's spirit and crush their motivation. 
o	It is immensely significant to respect individual’s privacy, including children. Privacy is tied to freedom. It helps us to protect our thoughts and even physical safety. Parents’ intervention might cause a lot of pressure on children. For example, when I was in primary school, my parents had to sign my transcripts and it made me faintly tense.


	Children should learn paint or draw
o	It gives the children a head start by helping them to be good with their hands. The more you paint the better you can convey what in your mind is on the paper. They will brush up on their skills. When I was a child I was always painting and thankfully now my handwriting is acceptably neat. 
o	Besides, without a doubt having fun is every child’s right. Painting is marvelously entertaining, it delights children. Children enjoy drawing and it makes them happy.

	Gifted children should be treated differently 
o	Some gifted children may develop highly inflated and unrealistic expectations for themselves. They might desire to be the best for good. And, any divergence from this path will be perceived as a failure and make them disappointed. Were I a father, I would never treat my children as overly special to let them enjoy their lives to the full. 
o	On the other hand, gifted children have unique educational needs due to their intellectual difference and require special academic services. For example, children who are strong in math should have extracurricular classes.

	Homework for students
o	It’ll help students study throughout the semester, on a regular basis, and avoid procrastination and keep track of class discussions, thus consolidate the lessons and store the information in their long-term memory. As a result, their lessons will not accumulate and they won’t need to cram before the exams. When I was a freshman, I always crammed before exams. So not only did I get bad grades, but I also had terrible nights back then.
o	Secondly, homework will help students diagnose their weaknesses and work on them. Also, teachers will provide them with optimal feedback, which will help students stay on the right track. I took a course on electronics, and I really learned everything in homework questions/assignments. 

	Study in the morning
o	It’s easier to maintain focus in the morning. For some demanding courses, it’s enormously important to fully focus. I’m a morning person 


	 Schools 
o	Schools should provide a congenial atmosphere, not an oppressive one. The more delight intermingles with education, the better the students learn the lessons.
o	Student life obviously encompasses a vast range of activities and is of bewildering complexity, which stresses them out and makes them tense.
o	Student life is full of assignments, homework, seminars, conferences, etc. Psychologically speaking, stress-induced diseases are intensely prevalent among students. For example, when I was a student, I was under an intense pressure to do my senior project, which turned into anxiety, and made me indulge myself in eating junk food and gain extra weight. 
o	Joining such activities will help student be in good spirits, and they will unwind and get the good vibes to study more efficaciously. 
o	Quality is of more importance than quantity. 


	 Online classes or actual classes

o	Actual classes will encourage students to take part in classes more willingly, and they will feel the competition between classmates to get the better of each other. Like their effort to answer the lecturer’s questions.
o	I took a course on robotics where students were allowed to ask questions whenever they had, and it made everyone want to be the most knowledgeable at any discussion.

	 Expel students who cheat on exam 
o	It’s not a good idea to expel students who cheat in an exam. First, Expulsion and suspension should only be used as a last resort. Therefore, students should be disciplined when they cheat in a test like being flunked and being forced to pass the course again or doing extra assignments and so forth. 
o	Secondly, Expulsion would have serious repercussions such as increase in unemployment. Schools should consider other aspects beyond the scope of education. For example, I had a classmate who expelled from university for cheating and dropped out of school, leading to misery, drug addiction and losing everything in his life.

	 Coed dormitory 
o	It is too improper for the university to establish segregated dorms. 
o	The dormitory is a miniature society indeed where you will learn how to get along with people other than your family members. Students can make friends with new people or even find their lifelong soulmates whom they want to spend the rest of their life with.
o	Students can get to know members of the opposite sex, and they will learn to get to grips with differences. It can be seen that sexism is more common in countries with segregated education systems.

	 University require Students to buy their own laptops 
o	It is too improper for university to force students to buy their own laptops.
o	First, students might not be able to afford personal computers. Laptops are exceedingly expensive. At least, uni had better give students loan.
o	Ex: I myself didn’t have my own laptop when I was freshman and bought it much later. 
o	 On the other hand, some say students need to have their own laptops to be able to work or study at any time whenever they can or they want. Furthermore it ensures privacy. You can have your files saved on your laptop and block access for others. 


	 Work on one field or several fields 
o	Nowadays multidisciplinary fields are very popular because most of the inventions are the results of using the advantages of one field in other fields’ applications. For instance, nowadays students tend to study multidisciplinary fields such as Mechatronics engineering because they will learn various subfields during their education.
o	On the other hand, considering the job opportunities in big companies, it is better to specialize in one field. The more you are specialized in a particular subject, the greater the chance to be hired in a good company. People need to use each other’s specialties in groups, and it is not possible for a person to be knowledgeable enough in all fields. In a team, enormously mammoth tasks will be divided into simpler ones and there would be the best person for each task who can do that in a more excellent way.

	Experienced teachers
o	Experienced teachers are familiar with the kinds of students in the classes and know how to handle disruptive pupils. Furthermore, they can improve efficiency and raise test scores more excellently. When I was in high school, I used to hate chemistry, but we had an accomplished chemistry teacher who aroused my interest and piqued my curiosity. 
o	Additionally, experienced teachers can help novices. Inexperienced teachers can heed their advice to be capable of demystifying matters better and be knowledgeable enough in teaching and education. 

	Internship
o	New graduates often face a chatch-22 situation when they look to enter the job market. So they can gain experience doing an internship on the side. Furthermore, it could lead to an opportunity to get an entry-level job at the same company. Although you might start with minimum wage, if you do excellent work and be a good team player. You could get a promotion or get a raise, hopefully both. A friend of mine got an internship in a company in 2015 and now he works in the same company and continues to prosper.
o	Internship at a company would highly improve one’s versatility. 

	Part-time job before college
o	It’d be better for students to do some casual work. 
o	First, they will earn a living, they can save up money to pay college expenses like buying textbooks, stationery, or paying the tuition fee, and stuff. For example, I myself worked at a company as a content provider as a sideline while finishing my masters.  and was able to university expenses.

	Job
o	Money is a factor, obviously. But seriously, it’s not that important. The most significant factor to consider before choosing your major is your Interest. It doesn’t matter how hard it is. If you wanna climb the ladder of success, you should do what you love, as the old saying goes. Thus you will have passion. And passion provokes effort, and effort is the only way to success. 
o	On the other hand, don’t disregard other factors like salary and job opportunities, as they will affect your future profoundly. We’re living in a world where money talks, you should earn enough money to stay solvent. You should set aside enough money to persevere in the face of adversity and survive the vicissitudes of life. 
o	Look for a job that keeps you motivated by its nature, not solely the paycheck. Because that wears off real fast.
o	The ability to look back at your life with satisfaction is more valuable than any number of digits in the bank. 
o	According to a recent job-satisfaction survey, accountants are the most unhappy. But as far as careers go, accounting is considered one of the best.


	Education or work experience
o	Both education and work experience are decisive factors.
o	On the one hand, you’ll stand a better chance of getting a job with a degree. With education, you will be well prepared and will get the required knowledge and other prerequisites for the job. I myself worked at a company as a content provider as a sideline while finishing my masters. My responsibilities were not in line with my education, but I saw my colleagues who had studied in pertinent fields worked much better than me.
o	On the other hand, having some work experience, one can earn crucial skills like communicating with experts and know how to tackle the tasks and clear hurdles that the job may entail.
o	It is more economical for a company to hire experienced people since a university education does not necessarily teach people all they need to start a career. 

	Work as librarian, teacher, doctor, …
o	A person spends at least 8 hours a day in his workplace.
o	Libraries usually have tranquil environment compared to shops that are excruciatingly bustling. 
o	You can stand a great chance to have good workmates. Librarians are usually well-read and cultured people. Libraries have a convivial and cordial atmosphere and you will have a nice time. I genuinely believe that having good colleagues is the most important quality of the work environment. 
o	Children are the future citizens of a country, one can derive a sense of satisfaction by helping them and contribute to the future progress of a country. 

	Do we have to make enemies to be successful
o	It’s too improper to say you must make enemies if you wanna climb the ladder of success. Although some successful people may have some enemies, there are whole host of successful people who are very self-effaced, gracious, and solicitous. So they have never tried to turn others against themselves. It depends to a great extent on one’s temperament, and how one decides to treat the others around them. Namely, a popular pop singer, why he/she should make enemies. 

	relationship
o	Honesty is of great importance and significantly cements the relationship between friends. Honest friends will never lead you astray. They will never misguide you. Namely, at school, an honest friend would never tell you study trivial matters.
o	Honest friends will never talk behind your back. They will say you your weaknesses and you would diagnose them and work on them to be a better person, which is invaluable. If you do not give the wrong people in your life a wide berth, you will never meet the right ones.
o	forge a relationship
o	convivial atmosphere
o	cordial atmosphere
o	As far as happiness is concerned, it’s all about relationships, I think. You know, you need strong social networks. There’s a lot of research that shows people who are lonely aren’t just happy, but their health is affected, too. 
o	I’m not tempted by the money.

	Music
o	Music is a crucial element of our lives.
o	Listening to music is a great way to get rid of gnawing anxiety and get the good vibes to stay focused and work more efficaciously. Music delights students. It floods your brain with endorphins and oxytocin which in turn boosts your mood. 
o	Music will revitalize and energize students and will help them be in good spirits and to maintain focus for their assignments. I always try to listen to music when I am idling. 

	Health
o	Many health problems appear as a result of poor diet and nutrition. Obesity is prevalent among students and junk food is the main culprit.

o	Being aware of the latest news is a great way to interact with others.

	Paper books or digital ones
o	People don’t show interest in reading books today because of the other sources of information available.
o	 With digital devices, you can carry a large number of books in a light-weight device with you wherever you want. For example, I have an e-reader with more than 53 books on it. I don't even have enough space in my room to hold this many books, let alone carrying them with me.
o	Furthermore, electronic devices allow you to easily highlight any part of the book, add text, and delete it whenever you want. You can also easily search for a phrase or subject that you want to read about in a book, which is impossible in paper books.

	Environment
o	 Use reusable bags:
o	 It will reduce the use of plastic. The more plastic we use, the more dangers will occur in our environment, and the higher the risk of suffering from the negative effects of them. We have to prevent build up in landfill. 
For example, look at the oceans that are fouled almost beyond recovery. 
o	 Additionally, the governments can use the revenue from environmentally related taxes to provide incentives for green activities like the campaigns that aim to raise awareness of the environment or set up recycling factories.

	Used stuff
o	It’s not a good idea to collect used stuff. Unless they have a sentimental value or are being used on a regular basis. Otherwise, they will just clutter up your room. … is a less is more kind of person she throw things away easily or at best, donate them.
o	It’d be better to recycle scraps. That way, you can save up money as well as being environmentally friendly person. I myself have recently used a plastic shampoo bottle as a phone holder. 



	Celebrities

o	Do humanitarian activities and to help the homeless, orphaned or disaster-hit people. 

o	There are pros and cons to either route.

	Share room or not
o	First, sharing a room/house with others is cost-effective. It is more economical because everybody shares bill payment or rent. It will cost a fortune to rent an exclusive house and as a student, you might not be able it. 
o	Secondly, living with others will boost your self-esteem and self-confidence. You will learn how to get along with people other than your family members.

o	It will also enable you to move toward complete independence.  

	Travel alone or with others
o	You can explore unknown places without restrictions and establish contact with local people and learn about different cultures. 

	Living in City
o	In most of the cities, there are different activities for people of all different kinds of interest to stop them from getting bored, such as restaurants, museums, parks and much more.
o	The noise level in major cities is higher than in the suburbs. The teeming streets of the city and traffic contribute to the noise as well as trains, planes, public events, etc. I presume my character to be introverted. An introvert would rather be in a quiet environment.
o	Urban areas are more dangerous than smaller towns. The more people live in a place, the more crimes happen there.
o	In a city, you will meet new people everywhere you move. New people who have had very different life experience than yours and this can give you new perspectives. 
o	Despite the high costs of living in the city, there are many more job opportunities with high salaries in cities because of big company offices like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.

	Cooking at home
o	There are benefits to cooking at home, you can save money compared to ordering from a restaurant or using TV-dinners as well as using healthier ingredients and setting portions to a reasonable size.

	Regular exercise 
o	In this day and age, hustle and bustle of modern life lead us to a hectic lifestyle. We are preoccupied with our jobs. Some of us are overburden with their jobs. They work from dawn till dusk. So it’s fairly difficult to open up your schedule for exercising. You know?
o	On the other hand, it’d be better to exercise on a regular basis. Regular exercise helps you get rid of many health problems as well as being in shape. It will promote better sleep. You will fall asleep faster and deepen your sleep. Besides it can increase your life expectancy and boost your mood through being healthy and not having diseases. 


	Indoor activity or outdoor activity
o	There are pros and cons to either routes. 
o	Each of these cut both ways.
o	On the one hand, with outdoor activities people will catch some rays, which helps them ward off depression/revitalize and relieve stress. I myself usually enjoy going out to the beach and doing some sunbathing.
o	On the other hand, some people are introverted and tend to stay in solitude. Introverts would rather exercise alone while listening to their favorite song. 
o	On a stormy weather you would rather stay in home instead of being in danger. 

	Government
o	Governments can curb the sale of unhealthy food w/o restricting people’s right to choose them. 

	Planning 
o	Planning before doing things will minimizes uncertainty which contribute significantly to relieving stress. 
o	Planning facilitates controlling. It provides pre-determined goals and standard of performance.
o	By scheduling you will have a big picture on what you should do. There would be pre-defined goals and instructions to achieve. 
 
	Spur of the moment decision or planning before
o	In the majority of cases, you should mull over important things before doing anything. If you make decisions in haste, you might be full of remorse. For example, some years back I was always 
o	 In some instances, if you make a mistake, you might be forced to start from scratch and that takes a long time. 
o	In some situations, you need to be able to make timely decisions in the nick of time. You should think fast and take prompt action. For example, I once inadvertently pushed the accelerator instead of the brake in a panic I plowed into the car in front. 


	News
o	News is of great importance. 

	Cosmetic surgery

Ex: For example one of my cousins once wanted to look like Barbie by doing plastic surgeries tens of times.  ssss



	Happiness
o	We’re brought up to believe that happiness means having astronomical amounts of money – a big house and everything.
o	You can’t define happiness in terms of what you own.
o	No possession in the world can make you truly happy.
o	When it comes to being truly happy, it’s about doing things that have meaning. You can’t just sit around, waiting to be happy. 
o	As far as happiness is concerned, it’s all about relationships, I think. You know, you need strong social networks. There’s a lot of research that shows people who are lonely aren’t just happy, but their health is affected, too. 
o	Happier people tend to be more productive, leading to greater economic wealth. Moreover, they are often healthier, resulting in lower spending on health care.
o	Ideas for producing happier citizens might include:

	and finding ways to stimulate kindness toward others, which is known to make both givers and receivers happier.
o	The staple ingredient for a happy life is love.
o	Happy people tend to be good citizens and contribute more to their communities. 


	Consult older people
o	Although some say older people have more life experience and can counsel young generations better, it’s not something that can always be applied. They grew up in utterly different age and they usually judge things today by their standards back then. So their solutions might be obsolete. For example, you wanna find a job, old people may not be familiar with those rewarding freelance jobs that exist today. 
o	Secondly, in this fast-paced world it seems more rational to consult your peers because they grew up in the same period and can suggest modern ways to solve the problems that work better. Besides. They can understand you in a superior way.



	Famous people privacy or not
o	It is immensely significant to respect individual’s privacy, including celebrities. Privacy is tied to freedom. It helps us to protect our thoughts and even physical safety. Media scrutiny and celebrity gossips have ruined a whole host of famous people’s lives and lead them into trouble. For instance you can find many star couples divorced under the pressure made by society.
o	In addition, some celebrities are role model for teenagers and are an influence on them. Knowing their bad habitat, the youngsters will copy them and will be corrupted. Smoking is an exemplar that suffice to make the point. 


	Buy new products or wait for reviews
o	By reading the reviews you won’t be tricked by ads. No seller will tell you the cons of their product. I remember one time 
o	Some new products might well have defects that producers will fix them in later versions or publish an errata.


	Museums
o	Museums provide an effective way of learning. A single visit to a museum can expose the visitors to in-depth information on a subject. When I was a child I visited a nature museum near my aunt’s house and I still can remember everything because the information somehow inscribed in my mind. 
o	You can spend as much or as little time as you like. The hustle and bustle of modern life lead us to a hectic lifestyle. So we are preoccupied with our jobs and it’s fairly difficult to open up your schedule for reading books or even watching documentaries. Thanks to museums you can catch a wealth of information in one hour visit. 



	Rich people should help poor ones
o	Affluent people should help poor ones in order to make the society a better, more humane place.
o	The seeds of many social maladies can be traced back to poverty. If destitution is rife in a society, the crime rate will rise alarmingly, which affect all people’s lives including the rich ones. 
o	Help philanthropic organizations and do humanitarian activities and try to help the homeless, orphans, or disaster victims. 


	Writing or speaking
o	In writing there is the ability to revise and edit dozens of times. You can read what you have written several times and change it before you submit it. For example, it was enormously difficult for me to explain my master’s senior project in the defense session, while my dissertation was extremely thick and I explained everything in complete detail there.
o	Speaking is harder than writing because it is performance. You should watch your tone of voice and tread lightly. You should pay painstaking attention to your vocal emphasis and body-language. 
o	While speaking you would be able to convey what in your mind is in a more excellent way. Your intonation and vocal emphasis will help you as tools to better explain the subject to others. There is a lot of research showing that writing expresses only 7% of the author's intentions. For this reason, there are many cases in which text messages have led to misunderstandings and misinterpretations.
o	Writing must be self-contained. There isn’t body language or vocal emphasis as everything must be in words. 



Speak in praise = extolling-extol
