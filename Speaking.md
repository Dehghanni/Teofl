- **Family**

- Family is the sole group who truly cares for us and, we can count on them whenever we run into difficulties. They give us their unqualified support and subordinate their personal interests to those of us. For example, on a rainy day, you can cadge money from your family and they might help you without reservation.
- Our family members are the ones who know us the best and can advise us better than any other people. For example, when you wanna choose a major to study, it seems more rational to consult your family because they know your interests in a superior way.

- **Children**

- Parents should not constrain their children from doing what they want. They should incent them without incensing them.
- Were I a father, I would never interfere in my children&#39;s lives and would let them do whatever they want at their own free will. My parents used to force me to be a doctor, which was utterly preposterous.
- Parents who give their children preferential treatment are sowing the seeds of future problems.
- Children who engage in competition earn critical social skills by interacting with others in addition to learning the value of hard work and developing self-confidence and self-esteem.

Parents may blame them for their failure in a course without deep knowledge for reasons. They intensify the tension on students. Which aggravate the student&#39;s spirit and crush their motivation.
- It is immensely significant to respect individual&#39;s privacy, including children. Privacy is tied to freedom. It helps us to protect our thoughts and even physical safety. Parents&#39; intervention might cause a lot of pressure on children. For example, When I was in primary school, my parents had to sign my transcripts and it made me faintly tense.

- **Children should learn paint or draw**

- It gives the children a head start by helping them to be good with their hands. The more you paint the better you can convey what in your mind is on the paper. They can brush up on their skills. When I was a child I was always painting and thankfully now my handwriting is acceptably neat.
- Besides, without a doubt having fun is every child&#39;s right. Painting is marvelously entertaining, it delights children. Children can enjoy drawing and it makes them happy.

- **Gifted children should be treated differently**

- Some gifted children may develop highly inflated and unrealistic expectations for themselves. They might desire to be the best in perpetuity. And, any divergence from this path will be perceived as a failure and make them disappointed. Were I a father, I would never treat my children as overly special to let them enjoy their lives to the full.

- **Homework for students**

- It can help students study throughout the semester, on a regular basis, and avoid procrastination and keep track of class discussions, thus consolidate the lessons and store the information in their long-term memory. As a result, their lessons will not accumulate and they won&#39;t need to cram before the exams. When I was a freshman, I always crammed before exams. So not only did I get bad grades, but I also had terrible nights back then.
- Homework will help students diagnose their weaknesses and work on them. Also, teachers will provide them with optimal feedback, which will help students stay on the right track. I took a course on electronics, and I really learned everything in homework questions/assignments.

- **Study in the morning**

- It&#39;s easier to maintain focus in the morning. For some demanding courses, it&#39;s enormously important to fully focus. I&#39;m a morning person

-   **Schools**
  - Schools should provide a congenial atmosphere, not an oppressive one. The more delight intermingles with education, the better the students learn the lessons.
  - Student life obviously encompasses a vast range of activities and is of bewildering complexity, which stresses them out and makes them tense.
  - Student life is full of assignments, homework, seminars, conferences, etc. Psycho **l** ogically speaking, stress-induced diseases are intensely prevalent among students.

  - By joining such activities students can unwind and get the good vibes to study more efficaciously.
  - Quality is of more importance than quantity.

-   **Online classes or actual classes**

  - Actual classes will encourage students to take part in classes more willingly, and they will feel the competition between classmates to get the better of each other. Like their effort to answer the lecturer&#39;s questions.
  - I took a course on robotics in which students were allowed to ask questions whenever they had, and it made everyone want to be the most knowledgeable at any discussion.

-   **Expel students who cheat on exam**
  - It&#39;s not a good idea to expel students who cheat in an exam. Expulsion and suspension should only be used as a last resort. Schools should consider other aspects beyond the scope of education. Students should be disciplined when they cheat in a test like fail and force to pass the course again or extra assignments and so forth.
  - Expulsion would have serious repercussions such as increase in unemployment. For example, I had a classmate who was expelled from university for cheating and dropped out of school, leading to misery and losing everything in his life.

-   **Coed dormitory**
  - Dormitory is a miniature society indeed where you will learn how to get along with people other than your family members. Students can make friends with new people or even find their lifelong soulmates who they want to spend the rest of their life with.
  - Students can get to know members of the opposite sex, and they will learn to get to grips with differences. It can be seen that sexism is more common in countries with segregated education systems.

-   **University require Students to buy their own laptops**

- **Experienced teachers**

- Experienced teachers are familiar with the kinds of students in the classes and know how to handle disruptive pupils. Thus, they can improve efficiency and raise test scores in a more excellent manner. When I was in high schools, I used to hate chemistry, but we had an accomplished chemistry teacher who aroused my interest and piqued my curiosity.
- Additionally, experienced teachers can help novices. Inexperienced teachers can heed their advice to be capable of demystifying matters better and be knowledgeable enough in teaching and education.

- **Internship**

- Students can gain experience doing an internship. Furthermore, it could lead to an opportunity to get an entry-level job at the same company. Although you might start with minimum wage, if you do excellent work and be a good team player. You could get a promotion or get a raise, hopefully both. A friend of mine got an internship in a company in 2015 and now he works in the same company and continues to prosper.

- **Part-time job before college**

- It&#39;d be better for students to do some casual work.

- On the other hand, don&#39;t disregard other factors like salary and job opportunities, as they will affect your future profoundly. We&#39;re living in a world where money talks, you should earn enough money to stay solvent. You should set aside enough money to persevere in the face of adversity and survive the vicissitudes of life.
- Look for a job that keeps you motivated by its nature, not solely the paycheck. Because that wears off real fast.
- The ability to look back at your life with satisfaction is more valuable than any number of digits in the bank.
- According to a recent job-satisfaction survey, accountants are the most unhappy. But as far as careers go, accounting is considered one of the best.

- Both education and work experience are decisive factors.
- On the one hand, you&#39;ll stand a better chance of getting a job with a degree. with education, you will be well prepared and will get required knowledge and other prerequisites for the job. I myself worked at a company as a content provider as a sideline while finishing my masters. My responsibilities were not in the line of my education, but I saw my colleagues who had studied in pertinent areas worked much better than me.
- On the other hand, having some work experience, one can earn crucial skills like communicating with experts and know how to tackle the tasks and clear hurdles that the job may entail.
- It is more economical for a company to hire experienced people since university education does not necessarily teach people all they need to start a career.

Although successful people may have some enemies, there are whole host of successful people who are very self-effaced, gracious, and solicitous. So they have never tried to turn others against themselves. It depends to a great extent on one&#39;s temperament, and how one decides to treat the others around them.
