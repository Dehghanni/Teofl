<h1> Writing </h1>

## **Task2 - Independent**

### **Tips** :

* It'd be better to divide the time and move on to the next part at specific minutes: 27-23-16-8-4 resectively for Planning-Intro-1st Body paragraph-2nd Body paragraph-Conclusion
* Planning is of utmost importance
* For Planning you just need to write a couple of things on paper: agree/disagree/choice, reasons, words that help you remember

#### **Introduction:**

* General statement

What is the field of the question? Only 1 sentence \(not that general or complicated that take long to narrow down\) Do not spend a lot of time – relevant – Not too general or too detailed – Do not answer the question

* Topic restatement

Paraphrase: You need the skill of paraphrasing in Intro and Conclusion

State all the alternatives mentioned in the question

Suppose that the reader does not know about the question

* Thesis statement

Choose one side

Should be very clear

All of the alternatives should be mentioned

* Transition sentence

Use a simple template

#### **Topic sentence:**

1. Reader should be able to guess the question from topic sentence.
2. Do not use pronoun in topic sentence\(Take it into consideration especially for second reason\)
3. Thesis statement should not be long.
4. Thesis statement should not be lead-in or warm-up sentences, and it should point to the main idea.
5. Every reason that you will explain in the paragraph should be mentioned in the topic.
6. Topic sentence should not be fact. It should be something disputable or provable. 

supporting sentences could be facts and examples.

supporting sentences had be better to be possibly dividable into major and minor supporting sentences.

concluding sentence is rephrased of topic sentence or summary of major sentences.

There should be no irrelevant sentence.

Concluding sentences transitions: **All in all, In short, Consequently, In summary**

#### **Conclusion:**

Read the question before writing the conclusion \(because you did not write about conclusion in Planning\)

Paraphrase your Thesis statement again

Only mention the reasons again\(Or you can simply say "aforementioned reasons"\)

It is possible to end the conclusion with a suggestion or rhetorical question.

conclusion should be reviewing two reasons.

#### **Intro** :

In modern era,

Throughout history, human beings have perpetually been seeking …

Since the dawn of civilization,

For most of human history,

In the preceding decades …

Whether ... or not **is a matter of opinion** ; some people are of the opinion that …, but some people believe otherwise.

Others, on the other hand, take a radically different point of view and allege that …

Opinions\(opinion=school of thought\) are divided as to whether the role … plays is of more significance or that of …

The question which has been raised since the advent of … is ~~that~~ what constitutes …

A vexed question amongst the myriad of questions which arise here is ~~that~~ …

… has perpetually been a bone of contention.

But whose relative importance is still debatable /is open to debate/ is a matter of debate.

My impression is that …

Questions that have 3 options: Although … and … are important, my impression is that … is of utmost significance/of essence. Notwithstanding the fact that … cannot be disregarded/cannot be considered insignificant , it is my firm conviction that …

The following explanations will further elaborate **on** this perspective.

There are numerous reasons, two of which I will explain.

There are numerous reasons, among which two stand out.

In what follows, I will elaborate **on** my point of view.

In following paragraphs, my viewpoint will be elucidated.

In what follows, I will boil this down to a couple of main reasons.

#### **First Body:**

First, and most obvious,

First and foremost,

First of all,

To begin with,

This exemplar will suffice to illustrate the point that ...

A case in point is ...

#### **Second Body:**

Another equally important factor to take into consideration is …

Another worthwhile reason to be mentioned here is \(the fact that\)…

On the other hand,

Examples of this abound in the world.

#### **Conclusion:**

In conclusion,

To summarize,

To wrap it up,

To bring everything into conclusion,

It is far from straightforward/ too difficult to squarely pinpoint \(the cause of …\)whether the role … plays is of more significance or that of …

It is far from straightforward to squarely pinpoint exactly what/how/why … \(It is too difficult to squarely pinpoint the cause of \)

Whether … or not ~~,~~ need further considerations.

taking all the aforementioned reasons into consideration, we can conclude that

Considering the aforementioned reasons, we can conclude that …

all the aforementioned reasons lead us to the conclusion that

all the above-enumerated reasons converge to the point that …

Based on the aforementioned reasons, it can be surmised that … has deleterious/detrimental/devastating/irreparable effects on ….

Other factors are also at work, but are subsidiary to this one.

unpleasantly surprising is the fact that …

Alas, and obviously, some acute problems would crop up that constitute a serious threat to the future. Therefore, prompt action must be taken, otherwise, a terrible fate awaits us in the not too distant future.

Otherwise, a spirit of hopelessness may pervade society.

Should the government does …, …

Once again, it must be stressed that ...

It is highly anticipated that

It is suggested that a thorough and comprehensive survey beconducted ~~carried out~~ to appraise the efficacy/efficiency/effectiveness of this policy.

It is suggested that an extensive body of research beconducted ~~carried out~~ to ascertain exactly what would happen in case ... was ... .

It would be palpably unwise to draw firm conclusions from the results of a few pieces of research.

## Brainstorm

* **Playing sports can teach people lessons about life.**
  * Playing sports will teach you success and defeats are two sides of the same coin—twins, but not enemies. It teaches us that failure can be turned into success if we bounce back higher than we fall. Failures happen "for" us, not "to" us, and nothing more than losing hope can sabotage our success. For example, it has been seen many times that in a football match, the losing team was able to get the better of the opposing team and take the lead in the second half and snatch victory from jaws of defeat.
  * Playing sports will **inculcate/instill** an attitude of teamwork spirit into individuals.->

    When engaging in sports activities, one learns how to **avoid social** loafing and cooperate with others in order to achieve the common objective of the group ->

    this quality is a must-have and sought-after skill in the workplace ->

    lead to better productivity, more efficacy, reduced costs, greater profitability, and many other benefits.

    EX: Going back to earlier example of a football match, a case in point is that a striker must be humble enough to pass to his teammate if he is in a better position to score a goal.

  * The ability to take failure and success alike is a valuable life experience that sports can teach us. When asked to what they attribute their outstanding achievements, successful individuals mention their mental outlook to embrace both triumph and defeat. This quality can be achieved by playing sports as it makes us understand that mistakes and failures can teach us valuable things.
* **One of the best ways to learn about a country's culture is through watching its TV shows.**
  * TV shows hold up a mirror to society and its culture as they perfectly represent the preferences of people in their daily lives. What we view in a filmed entertainment is an average lifestyle, workplace dynamics, relationships, and preferences such as fashion trends, interior design styles, and popular cars, to name but a few. All the aforementioned details in televised contents reflect the culture of a country to a great extent. In other words, a TV show is a microcosm of the country and the best representative of the culture. Viewing prime-time programs, one can gain information as much as they would if they had lived in the country themselves. For example, comparing the televised contents of the US to those of European countries, we can acquire a wealth of information. A footage of American traditional life explains that they prefer to live in spacious properties and drive big cars such as pickup trucks, SUVs, or even muscle cars. These preferences have their root in the culture and lifestyle of the American people. On the other hand, living in tiny apartments in high-rise buildings and driving coupés is something that strikes us the most when viewing films about the Green continent's countries.
  * Shows broadcast by television convey some direct or indirect messages that represent every given country's social, political, and economic movements. The media are inextricably intertwined with the country's culture. Gone are the days when directors produce movies that could be summarized in the romantic relationships or arrival of aliens at the Earth's surface. Today's shows and movies, in fact, mirror current events. From a sociological standpoint, for example, European TV shows usually promote interracial marriage and egalitarianism in an effort to fight racism and xenophobia. This is mainly because of the prevalent racial segregation in these countries. Likewise, American directors glorify single parenthood and send out this message that being an unmarried mother does not carry the social stigma that it used to and is nothing to be ashamed of. Conservative Middle Eastern countries, on the other hand, attach importance to the value of traditional families. The contents of their TV shows rebel against carefree relationships in Western countries and emphasize marriage as a sacred institution.
* **It is better for government to spend money on building modern housing than on preserving historic or traditional buildings and homes..**
  * These ancient constructions have educational values and represent the **rich cultural heritage** of a country. The data and information that these old sites represent range from invasion of a foreign country and the introduction of a new culture to the dominant religion and architecture in various periods. This information will make people proud of their country and appreciate their forefathers' contribution to the glamorous history of their nation. A recently conducted research in the Ohio State University reveals that
  * The archaic buildings serve as tourist hotspots and spawn a huge influx of domestic and foreign visitors to the place. Tourism is the mainstay of many countries There are a whole host of tourists around the world who have an **insatiable** desire to discover new historic places. They travel to **quench their curiosity** no matter how far they have to go or how hazardous the travel may be. Government funds dedicated to conserving old buildings will attract that potentially curious visitors and can make truckloads of money by this new source of revenue.
* **Celebrities, such as actors, musicians and athletes, sometimes express their political views in public. Some people appreciate knowing the political views of celebrities. Others think it is not appropriate or useful to know the political views of celebrities. Which opinion do you agree with?**
  * Some celebrities are not averse to getting pecuniary advantages by deception. To rephrase, some of the public figures are not bona fide and are prone to trick people in order to line their own pockets. Rarely do celebrities provide something useful and objective in their perspectives or an idea they themselves believe in. They might have political affiliation and it is often seen that politicians give these famous personalities financial assistance or commencement certificate for their commercial activities as a quid pro quo to take part in their election campaign or to express their opinion against a special candidate to impugn their reputation. The same is true when it comes to colluding with businessmen to endorse their products. They offer public figures a bribe to represent their products way better than what they really are. In this case, gullible and susceptible people will be misled. They will change their criteria that they used to consider when voting or buy some fake products hardly live to their claimed quality and functions.
  * The overwhelming majority of famous personalities are not politically conscious and their opinions and beliefs should not be taken seriously. Needless to say, celebrities are more known for their wealth, fame, glamor, and attractive appearance. They have neither a superior academic credential nor valuable experience in important fields such as economics and politics. The only thing that has made them noted and celebrated is the hype surrounding them. Giving attention to this group of society and their ideologies will yield nothing but exposure to inaccurate and narrow perspectives. For example, so fascinated was I with a physically attractive actor that I ended up following his wrong political and social views blindingly. In retrospect, that cost me a lot: I was pushed aside by my friends and even family members because of following those wrong perspectives. If I could wind the clock back to my teenage years, I would not listen to that politically illiterate actor's ideologies.
* \*\*Which of the following choice do you think has the greatest/far-reaching/sweeping impact on environmental protection?

  a. Governmental Regulations

  b. Environmental Awareness Groups

  c. Individual Efforts.\*\*

  * To save the environment and the God-given tranquil haven of peace and serenity:

A: Government regulation

* ✔As the biggest organization in the country, the government had better to impose stringent restrictions in order to curb the ever-growing contamination of big companies and circumscribe them. They do so by:
  * Prosecuting contaminative activities in order to stem the rise in pollution.
  * Suspending companies' commercial activities
  * adopting prohibitive measures such as the threat of shutting down the companies which exceed the imposed maximum level of pollution.
  * Not issuing the commencement certification for businesses that are not well-equipped with a proper waste disposal system.
  * Monetary punishment and levying a high tax on contaminative industries
  * Offering incentive packages such as giving low-interest loans, tax exemption, and tax costs if companies employ green technologies and modern waste disposal plants.
  * All these regulations will keep the gloomy clouds of exhaust spewed by factories in check.
* ✔✔The rules defined by governments have been assessed by well-rounded experts and are excellent measures to take, thereby reducing the wastage of resources in addition to the low risk of hurting the environment.

B: Environmental awareness groups

* ✔environmentally-conscious organizations are usually non-profit and conduct their activities for the sake of nature itself. They expose companies and industries' pollution and put the government under immense pressure to adopt proper measures to curb them. They foreground this important issue which might have otherwise gone unnoticed.
* ✔✔Launching such campaigns will promote public awareness about the environment. Many people unknowingly contaminate their surroundings because of a paucity of proper education. These campaigns and groups can teach citizens the best ways of disposing of their trash such as waste segregation and using suitable trash cans. These groups may mitigate the number of streets and beaches littered with cans, bottles, and papers by educating people.

C: Individual efforts

* ✔Human activities are the major source of pollution and human effort can control this serious source of contamination. People take a toll on the environment by:
* 🔰Dust and debris created in construction sites
* 🔰Household waste and inefficient air conditioner system
* 🔰Animal farming by dedicating land to farms and producing excessive methane gas.
* 🔰Factory farming and using toxic substances and chemical fertilizers in private farms and yards.
* 🔰Using SOVs \(single-occupant vehicles\) which brings vehicular movements to a standstill.
* 🔰Improper ways of waste disposal, intentionally or unintentionally.
* Using fuel-inefficient vehicles or imbalanced wheels of the car
* All these practices are threatening to nature and should be reversed by individual effort.
* ✔✔When people contribute their bit individually in saving nature, this will become a civic responsibility and a social obligation because citizens will start doing the same when they see others as environmentally-conscious citizens.
* **Do you agree or disagree that it is important for young people to learn some domestic skills like cooking, sewing and taking care of children?.**
  * In this globally interconnected world, where living away from one's family is of high probability, learning practical skills can ease the difficulty of running a single-person household and standing on one's own feet. It will eliminate the need for other's help and is a good practice of self-reliance. It will also enable one to move toward complete independence.
  * The ability to do household chores helps a person save a great deal of money. In this case, there is no need to ask a repairman to repair home appliances or hire a babysitter. In our family, we do everything ourselves, from soldering damaged electronic PCB\(Printed Circuit Board\) of the TV to servicing the car and building repairs such as mending plumbing system, to name but a few.
  * Domestic skills, craftsmanship, and taking care of children are no longer at-home skills; rather, they can be extra or even the main source of revenue. By developing proficiency in these skill sets, one can make a lot of money, even beyond the dreams of avarice. To be financially independent and have a potential job opportunity, children should learn these skills.
* \*\*Which one of the following values is the most important to share with a young child \(5-10 years old\)?
  1. Being helpful
  2. Being honest
  3. Being well organized.\*\*
  4. From a social standpoint, nothing better than sharing integrity and truthfulness can grow young children into God-fearing, law-abiding citizens when they attend the society a few years down the road. A child aged between 5 to 10 spends his formative years. In this period, the mind is like a sponge, soaking up and absorbing innumerable drops of the behaviors of its surroundings. Share honesty with the kid, see the fruits of this practice remaining forever; it—the fruit—neither spoils nor falls from the tree. It continues to grow to be the most distinguished characteristic of the person. The years of sharing integrity with children at their critical juncture of lives will teach them to stay true to their conscious and choose the right path when facing ethical quandaries. Once established and nurtured adequately, the honesty will carry over to one's adulthood, making his or her an ethical and morally competent person. There is the main reason behind this conclusion: an honest person has a monopoly on all acclaimed and acceptable dispositions and virtues.
  5. Furthermore, sharing honesty and presenting it in a positive light means taking a promising step to meet one of the most consequential responsibilities toward little ones: ensuring emotional security. Early childhood is identified with the time of play, fooling around, and causing troubles. Children—these little, professional troublemakers—have the fear of punishment and being blamed for their wrongdoing. Whether they have permissive, overindulgent, or overprotective parents, children know that they cannot get away with everything; punishment or asking to be answerable lies ahead of them. To get around the punishment, they resort to concealing the truth by choosing to be dishonest. If this trend continues, it will be only a question of time before they fall into the spiral of hiding the truth. Escaping accountability by lying, children will end up suffering malignant emotional consequences. They constantly tear apart inside as they never receive emotional support or sympathy in the case of making mistakes because they have chosen to conceal the truth as the relief to their wounds. If children learn to be honest from an early age, they will always reveal the reality no matter what. They know that the emotional support, warmth, and sympathy of their family members, friends, or teachers will outweigh the pain of the possible punishment and accountability.
* **The extended family \(grandparents, cousins, aunts, and uncles\) is less important now than it was in the past..**
  * People in this complicated life are notoriously preoccupied and pressed for time. They rarely communicate with their immediate family members, let alone with their distant relatives.
  * Given that family members, whether they are immediate or extended, are sometimes annoyingly inquisitive about one's matters, today's people are inclined toward being away from their distant relatives whose meddling in personal matters interferes with one's very independence and self-confidence.
* **Some people prefer to go and visit tourist attractions where there are many people. Others like the tourist attractions with fewer people.**
  * crowded tourist attractions are breeding grounds for illegal activities or morally and ethically questionable practices. For example, maimed begging, prostitution, and mugging are an inseparable part of every bustling location. These practices mainly target foreign visitors who stick out like a sore thumb among local people. What's more, these places are the potential targets of terrorist attacks.
  * Going sightseeing in less populated locations and tourist sites means saving valuable resources—time and pecuniary reserves— on hotel bookings, staying in long queues, and restaurants. When the location is the destination of a large influx of travelers and visitors, goods and services become exorbitantly expensive.
* **When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success. " Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?.**
  * Whether a person achieves his goals or not is not the question of luck, as it is a short-lived and infrequent experience.

    The factors contributing to one's success and progression are ones that are available whenever and wherever they face an obstruction.

    In many times, the only things that assists the person to surmount the obstacles are perseverance and hard work.

    Just because we are called a lucky person does not mean that we have a tool named 'luck' for removing barriers.

    It is beyond our control to use it. But this is not the case with hard work.

    When facing a challenge, we know that putting strenuous effort will solve the problem, no matter whether we are known as 'lucky' or not.

  * Luck cannot contribute to success. If it could, the most successful persons in the world would be perceived as the luckiest. The reality, however, is completely different. When we read the biography of highly successful people, one thing that strikes us the most is the fact that these people didn't have the basic possessions that we take for granted. For example, Hellen Keller did not speak, nor could she hear. But the paucity of these faculties didn't hinder her success. Steve Jobs also was given to adoption while he was a little child. Abraham Lincoln is also said to be a bad looking person, and Lionel Messi had Hormone deficiencies problem. These people are excellent epitomes of how hard work can beat unluckiness.
* **it is important to learn about other cultures.**
  * In this globally interconnected world, one should learn about other cultures to climb the ladder of success. This sophisticated world is characterized by its opportunities and being a global village. People leave their homeland to seek greener pastures in their job or academic career. Having information about other cultures can facilitate the process of this movement and modern immigration to a great extent. For example, for those who are inclined toward studying in the US, knowing about its culture, language, and dominant lifestyle can be of great help.
  * Since language and culture are inextricably connected, having a broad range of information about other cultures can boost one's job prospects. In this modern job market, being bilingual or even polyglot is the mandatory prerequisite of many professions. Acquiring knowledge about other cultures can equip you with what it takes to secure these kinds of positions.
  * Learning about other cultures, one can find similarities between the customs and traditions of those cultures with theirs. This may change your possible prejudgment, negative preconceived notion, or even blatant hostility against other minority groups. Understanding similarities while respecting unique differences can lead to an inclusive and ethnically and racially diverse society, without discriminative and racially prejudiced feelings toward minorities. Maybe, if Edinson Cavani had learned about British culture, he would not have hurt black-skinned people's feelings by his racially stereotyped comments.
* **It is important to read or watch the news presented by people whose views are different from your own or presented by people whose views are similar to your own?**
  * Exposure to news presented by someone cherishing opposite views to one's ideologies and perspectives can foster out of the box thinking. over-consumption of favorable news is an impediment to viewing problems, situations, and realities from different perspectives. It never helps one to think critically. On the other hand, in the case of being exposed to opposite views, one learns how to see the world from the lens of someone cherishing beliefs completely conflicting with those of one. This situation is a contributor to developing a big-picture perspective.
  * Being exposed to news presented by different people, one would be enormously open-minded. Should one person only listen to news from one-oriented sources, they cannot be aware of various angle of the matter. As a result, they are incapable of making proper judgements of the events happening around them. Extraordinarily eye-opener is the act of receiving information from miscellaneous sources that helps one make hear toward in their everyday life.
  * Embracing opposite views is a promising step toward enhancing the level of tolerance and accepting differences. Sad but true, in today's modern life, founded on individualism, "my own view" and "my preference" are phrases we hear frequently every day. People don't make a compromise, nor do they go beyond their selfish views. This autocratic and intransigent attitude is the byproduct of turning a deaf ear to opposite opinions. Listening to and reading news represented by people with whom we are not on the same page can make us more tolerant of different beliefs. We will no longer insult others' uniqueness and will appreciate their unique views and principles. Maybe this practice can eradicate the hostility and contemptuous feelings prevalent in modern society.
  * **Famous entertainers and athletes deserve to have more privacy than they have now.**
  * What makes celebrities a "celebrity" is media scrutiny and gossips. They owe the fame and adulation that they enjoy to these gossips and rumors. They know that media surveillance is like a double-edged sword: on the bright side, they get pleasure from the popularity and truckloads of money they make by means of being in the limelight. On the flip side, they should accept encroachment to their personal space. They do not have any right to complain about the circulation of their embarrassing images or rumors.
  * Public figures have an insatiable desire to flaunt and show off, which justifies their violated privacy. When they post their photos to brag about their immaculate sense of dressing, flamboyant lifestyle, chauffeur-driven limousine, and their expansive mansion full of golden accessories they themselves invite intrusion in their personal life. They knowingly get their privacy violated and they do not deserve privacy.
  * Everyone, be it a famous figure such as luminaries of stage and screen, icons of the music industry, and sports personalities or an ordinary citizen, needs privacy. It is a gross violation of human rights to get celebrities' well-deserved personal space violated only for a simple reason: to quench our insatiable desire to learn more about their personal matters. Public figures are human beings too. They need to live a normal life with their families, children, and friends. But unfortunately, the inquisitive society has taken away this chance from them. We get their privacy violated to such an extent that they cannot step outside without security personnel because they are constantly subject to paparazzi or even terrorists and criminals. By respecting their privacy we may help them live a normal life just like any of us.
  * Given the physically and intellectually demanding nature of athletes and artists' profession, they deserve uninterrupted privacy to focus on their training. As convenient as it may seem, being a professional actor or an athlete requires one to put their strenuous effort every day. This can be done only by allowing them to concentrate on their performance and daily training. We only see the tip of the iceberg, not what is beneath. Celebrities, alas, resort to drug and drinking to cope with the pressure they endure because we encroach on their personal space while practicing. We owe a debt of gratitude to public figures because of making us happy and entertained. Maybe, respecting their personal life is the best way to compensate for their

* **Which one can make friendship stronger?**

**-Having a good time with your friend \(Enjoy good time\)**

**-Solving your problem with him or her \(talk about problem\)**

**-Supporting each other**

* **Supporting each other.** Supporting each other will make both friends successful, and they will enjoy their friendship. One can count on their supportive friend whenever they run into difficulties. -> supportive friends subordinate their interests to those of their friends and help them to climb the ladder of success -> reciprocally their friend will keep their hand and help them be successful, which would be like snowball effect. Eventually they would be more successful and enjoy their relationship.
* Supportive friends will never be green with envy, and they never cause conflicts. They are happy to help. Supportive friends are not jealous, so they will never lead their friends astray. They will never misguide their friends with wrong information. Therefore, there would not be any conflict among them; on the contrary this will cement the bond between them. For example: studying with your friend at school.
  * \*\*Which one do you think is important to long-lasting friendship?

    A. help you when you need

    B. share same interest and hobby

    C. mutual trust\*\*

Human beings have perpetually been seeking a way to communicate with others. Friendship actually doesn't fit into any definition. It's a relationship that cannot be described with words. [friendship](https://www.mydomaine.com/what-is-friendship-1385639) is as important to our wellbeing as eating right and exercising. A vexed question that arises here is whether having common interests and hobbies plays a more significant role in friendship or friends solicitousness when they need one another. Although both of these are important, my impression is that mutual confidence of utmost importance.

* Honest friends would never talk behind your back – let you diagnose your weaknesses – you will work on them and be a better person which is invaluable. Ex: I could not help being furious when someone talks behind my back. On the other hand, some years back, I had this roommate who always tried to criticize me in a friendly way. I learned a lot from eating habits to how manage work-life conflict from him.
* Trustworthy friends will never lead you astray – they are not covetous or envious, so they will never misguide you by lying to you and giving you wrong info – you can count on them whenever you run into difficulties- Ex: I was studying for an exam, one my classmates who was terribly jealous, came up to me and said, "have you studied these chapters? The teacher told me that there will be some questions from these chapters." I spend the rest of the time studying those trivial matters which I later discovered were
* **Which kind of professors will you choose when selecting the courses? 1. Some professors who are voted to be the most popular one 2. Some professors who \*\*** are rewarded of outstanding research\*\*
  * Universities offer diversity of teachers and profs.
  * Research; the more research the more knowledge; you will palpably learn more; Experienced teachers are capable of demystifying the matters in a more excellent way, The professor shares his research experiences with the students. Ex: I was enrolled in a class whose instructor had a wealth of experience in conducting industrial projects and explained minute details about his projects. That course was, without exaggeration, the best course in my undergraduate years, and I learned a lot in that lesson.
  * More institutions will commission him to do other researches; know you -> opportunity to work for him; you will stand a better chance of getting a job. My roommate. A prof who published a paper in Nature; he was working on different projects simultaneously. He got a rewarding job in petroleum ministry with high salary.
  * \*\*It is important to have rules about the types of clothes that people wear in their

    workplace and at school.\*\*

  * No; improper to force people to wear a specific kind of cloth; wear whatever they want to feel comfortable; from pedagogically standpoint increase productivity; school uniform; inconvenient I couldn't understand well in class

  late time.

  Which one do you prefer?\*\*

One of the most talked about things[ **related to studying**](http://www.bellakulture.com/2015/04/the-best-study-tips-for-finals.html) is when exactly is the best time to hit the books? While this is most certainly affected by lifestyle and preferences, they are some pretty good reasons why as a college student you should study in the mornings.

* Morning; after a tiring day it is hard to retain what you studied; eventful day, read the matters more than once; the later you study, the more tired your brain is; the less you understand; in morning you had the chance to clear your mind and is easy to maintain focus; Ex: I am a morning person, and I perform immensely better in the morning. I will work doubly more from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. than from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. in the afternoon.
* As imp as brain condition is you physical condition, Mornings are great because you are at the most energetic level you'll be for the rest of the day. The more energetic you are, the more you are able to concentrate. I stayed up one whole night to study in order that I was sleepy next day I start reading the rest of the book I read about 10 pages and suddenly I recognized that I had read them the night before.

* House costs are exceedingly and exorbitantly high. Difficult for people to afford rentals. Share house with others is a cost-effective decision
* It is not impossible to live w/o having latest tech products, so we do not usually spend a stupefying amount of money on them.

* \*\*Are government doing good in educating people to pay attention to the importance

  of the food nutrition and healthy eating?\*\*

  * Eating impotance ----
  * No; government should pay painstaking attention in young people eating habits, the prevalence of obesity is exceedingly high among teenagers, TV advertisements are the main culprit. Kids today badger their parents to buy them junk foods. Ex: my cousin in only 13 years old and his weight is 130 pounds which is excruciatingly bad for a boy at that age.
  * Another culprit of obesity among people is social medium. you can hardly scroll through Instagram without passing by a must-try fat-laden and sugar-rich meals. Governments should try to dissuade people from eating unhealthy food. Ex: You might have seen such video clips of Big burgers, French fries, choice succulent steaks, pizzas and so forth.

* 190112WR\) **One can learn about another person from the books and movies that the person likes.**
  * ---find a suitable sentence for the time you cannot decide
  * The books and movies one like shows their taste. Your taste in choosing books and movies depends on your temperament. Knowing one's temperament, you can learn about them in an excellent way and find out their idiosyncrasy. Ex: I do not usually read a lot of books but the ones I like tend to be like serious, scientific books, concerning real issues and describing ppl in a realistic way. I am an engineer, I cannot find any point in those fiction books.
  * Personality and predisposition of a person is inextricably linked to the books and movies they like. Movies and books at times are for recreation and people may try different types of them. But they would not like all of them. If they like a specific genera, it means that it was in their line of thought or character. Ex: An extensive body of research that examine the link between human characteristics and region they live showed that people of different countries have different tastes in movies. Therefore can say one can learn about a person by watching movies.
* 190126WR \) **In order to succeed in study or job, the ability to adjust or adapt to changing conduction or circumstance is more important than having knowledge.**
  * Both of these abilities are important.
  * On the one hand, having relevant knowledge, one have the ability to know the tasks the job may entail and how to tackle them. They would be able to make timely decisions. Increase efficacy Ex: I worked at a company as a content provider as a sideline while finishing for my masters. My responsibilities were not in the line of my education, but I saw my colleagues who had studied in pertinent areas worked much better than me.
  * On the other hand, life is chaotic and it is impossible to predict all the circumstances. There might be abrupt changes in the life which one has to be able to adapt to them or devise a new way to surmount the obstacles; otherwise, they might wreak havoc on their lives. Ex: During the COVID-19 outbreak, a lot of people have been laid off, many other employees have been forced to work outsource. The people who were not familiar with internet, computer and stuff couldn't survive.
* **Leadership abilities**
  * Leader must be able to resolve/settle the sporadic conflicts/arguments among the members of the group.
  * Leader has to bear in mind that members of the group -------------------. Leader has to bear the responsibility for …-
  * A leader should contain his/her anger and never lose their composure even if others lose theirs. They should never let their emotion get the better of them.
  * A leader should never shirk his responsibilities.
* **Teamwork**
  * The importance of teamwork is essential in today's multidisciplinary world. In this day and age, most of the projects/jobs involve interacting with others that are not even in the same line of profession. The need for effective teamwork is critical for any business.
  * Teamwork enables the members to split an enormously mammoth task into simpler ones -> every person develops specialized skills and avoids multitasking, therefore there would be the best person for each task that can accomplish it in a more excellent way, and the work will not be daunting and wearing anymore. -> lead to better productivity, more efficacy, reduced costs, greater profitability, and many other benefits.
  * Teammates observe and depend on the quality of each other's work. When one team member's performance declines, others have the knowledge and motivation to help them improve. -> smoother and looser structure, convivial and cordial atmosphere ->
* **pay fee to drive in busy streets**
  * decrease \# of cars that produce prodigious amounts of GH gases signfcl – not reasonable to pay – encourage public transportation – reduce the pollution
  * use the revenue -> incentives for green activity, establish recycling companies
* **secure job low pay or high salary not secure**
  * each of these cut both ways.
  * A secure job with a guaranteed monthly paycheck consistent, afford opp to make master plan rather than living in a haphazard way or being in a precarious position, reduce anxiety and facilitate control, life-long desires,
  * unemployment rate is high – hard to find another job – possible to stay solvent/ stay afloat – half a loaf is better than no bread
* **Stop reading or listening to news**
  * news is often about bad events – stressful because sometimes, try as one might, they cannot make any change – makes you tense – affect your life adversely – even may lead to mental disorder –
  * n the other hand, raise your awareness, dvlp realistic perspective on life and world – make better and timely decisions – tax , ...
* **company -> better working env or technologies**
  * better env -> comfortable – convival and cordial atmos – willing to work, boost employees morale – retain their employees , lower turnover - passion ..
  * more meeting rooms -> more meeting – collective decisions – common goals – passionate – solve individual prblms together – more eager
* **long assgnmnt for young students**
* **people who always criticize are not good team members**
  * They do not work enthusiastically because of social loafing. People who always criticize Colleagues are in the habit of making their teammates the scapegoat for their mistakes. They are Toxic and notoriously hard-to-get-along-with and will be ostracized.
  * although criticism is a good thing as a fault-finding behavior – eye-opener – hard for evbdy to be told they are wrong – continuing criticsm will add fuel to the fire of conflicts
  * continual criticism impede the way to progress – better to be proactive and try to make change not only disapprove of others
* **Agree/disagree? In a team, those who do not accept others' criticism cannot succeed.**
  * Turning a deaf ear to the opposite voice of other teammates is nothing but sowing the seeds of one's own downfall because they will be deprived of others' help. Success is not something to be achieved all on your own; rather, you need to have others' supports, in any form, in your shared journey toward the team's established goals. When being indifferent toward criticism, you will present yourself stubbornly believer to the universal validity of your opinion. In this situation, no one in the group will show a tendency to help because they know their assistance and advice will not be taken into account. When no advice is given and no recommendation is made, the stubborn person will have difficulty living a normal life, let alone climb the ladder of success.
  * Standing rigidly on one's own side, no matter what, is self-sabotage as it will engage one in tensions and confrontations with others in collective activities. Taking part in a team is nothing but interacting and coming into contact with different opinions, ideas, suggestions, and ways of conduct. In this circumstance, opinions and ideas will be bounced back and forth inevitably. If you choose to be an autocratic person, dismissive to others' oppositions, you are inviting never-ending contentious discussions and debates in your life. These heated quarrels will drain you of your energy that should be spent in your circuitous path toward success and fulfilling your commitments. It is, therefore, evident that you should be open to criticism to avoid meaningless discussions and enjoy your symbiotically reciprocal relationships with other teammates to walk in the right direction.

**Example for environmental problems and government duties**

For example, a steel plant was built near my town. Due to the incorrect positioning, this factory is located in the direction of the winds toward the city, and all of its pollutions enter the city, which has caused dissatisfaction among residents. People even assembled in front of the municipality building and protested, but because of the large number of unemployed workers, the government failed to tackle the problem and the factory resumed operation.

This problem could be nipped in the bud.

**Example for my own experience in a job and benefit of relevant education**

I remember once working for a content providing company. My job was to produce technical content about new cars.

### Teamwork

The importance of teamwork is essential in today's multidisciplinary world.

In this day and age, most of the projects/jobs involve interacting with others that are not even in the same line of profession. The need for effective teamwork is critical for any business.

There is no "I" in a team.

**Teamwork enables the members to split an enormously mammoth task into simpler ones -> every person develops specialized skills, therefore there would be the best person for each task that can accomplish it in a more excellent way. -> lead to better productivity, more efficacy, reduced costs, greater profitability, and many other benefits.**

Teammates observe and depend on the quality of each other's work. When one team member's performance declines, others have the knowledge and motivation to help them improve. -> smoother and looser structure, convivial and cordial atmosphere ->

Approach your colleague with friendly questions, rather than accusations.

In a team, all members must work towards the main goals of the team

If a member of the group moves in the opposite direction, it slows down the process.

They might be **ostracized**.

Take my personal experience as an example, I was in a robotics group preparing for an international competition. Our group consisted of 6 people, each with his own task. The rivalry between teams was extraordinarily fierce and we had to work diligently to meet the deadline. One of the members of the group, who was in charge of documenting the group's activities, always objected, and this affects the whole group adversely. Such terrible was the situation that despite winning that year's tournament, the members refused to cooperate again for next years.

I remember once working for a content-providing company in which my responsibilities included producing technical content about new cars. One of my co-workers always objected, and we were changing schedules constantly, which slowed things down to a great extent, and we fell behind the market.

In this day and age of information explosion, news and opinions broadening people's understanding are given preference

**Fairy books or scientific books**

Some readers live vicariously through the main character of the book.
