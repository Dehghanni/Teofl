Subject: Is palm oil production positive or negative.
read:
The production of palm oil has a positive impact and should be expanded.
1. It can help protect forests and requires less land.
2. It can be used to produce environmentally friendly biodiesel.
3. It can reduce the poverty of small-scale farmers.
hearing:
Palm oil production will also have a negative impact and should not be expanded.
1. Although planting can become a forest and requires less land, cutting down other forests also destroys the forest.
2. It can be used to produce biodiesel, but after cutting down other forests, peat needs to be burned. The burning of this thing will produce more carbon dioxide, which is not good for the environment
3. It can reduce the poverty of small-scale farmers, but the small-scale farmers did not control palm oil production for a long time. Later, large-scale production institutions were also interested in palm oil, so small-scale production Farmers will lose control of palm oil production and increase their income very little.

Title: Protection of Endangered Birds Hermit Ibis.
read:
Protecting the endangered bird Hermit Ibis is difficult because:
1. habitat destruction The destruction of the living environment is mostly caused by human occupation.
2. Attacks on young birds and eggs by nearby predators (such as vultures and crows). Eggs and juvenile are vulnerable to the predators, which, however, cannot be killed because they are also important to ecosystem.
3. Protect endangered species. Usually scientists will raise them in captivity and release into the wild, but Hermit Ibis are migratory animals. They learn how and where to migrate from their parents. If they are raised in captivity and put back into nature, they cannot survive. .
hearing:
Problem can be solved
1. Hermit ibis can build nests in many places, artificial habitats, such as the outer walls of buildings. This is not a problem.
2. Although eggs and juvenile are vulnerable, their natural enemies are relatively timid. As long as humans blow away their natural enemies by blowing their whistle before eggs and juvenile reach adulthood, Hermit Ibis will have no problem living in adulthood.
3. Humans can also teach young hermit ibis how to migrate. For example, the pilot takes the young hermit ibis and flies along with them on the migration route. They can also learn how to migrate. After being released back to nature, they will not survive. any question.
